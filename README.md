About the course
----------------

"INE5451" is a course whose syllabus change in every edition.
The 2015.1 edition, lectured by Daniel Santana de Freitas,
was about cryptanalysis.

Some of the exercises required us to break cyphered texts
ciphered with (say) affine ciphers.
This repository contains tools that automate verifications
like frequency analysis.
